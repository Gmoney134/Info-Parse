## Executive Project Summary

### Problem Statement
False narratives rarely arrive labeled as false. They surface quietly as headlines, posts, and trending conversations, gaining traction long before their accuracy or intent can be evaluated. Social media platforms reward content that spreads quickly, while bots, coordinated groups, and selective framing make it harder to tell genuine conversation from deliberate influence efforts. In today’s information environment, speed and emotional resonance consistently outpace verification, allowing misleading or manipulative narratives to influence public opinion, decision-making, and trust. Existing responses to misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation tend to be reactive and disconnected, occuring only after misleading narratives have already taken hold and caused harm. In addition, current approaches tend to focus on individual claims rather than broader narrative patterns and on black-and-white conclusions without consideration for uncertainty and context. These limitations are particularly problematic in high-stakes domains like elections, public health, and geopolitical conflict. There's a clear need for tools that help users identify narrative risk early without overstating confidence or oversimplifying complex information dynamics.

#### Misinformation vs Malinformation vs Disinformation
* **Misinformation -** False information spread unintentionally typically due to misundertanding; no malicious intent
* **Malinformation -** Factually accurate information deliberately taken out of context or weaponized to mislead cause harm; malicous intent
* **Disinformation -** False information deliberately created and shared to deceive, influence, or cause harm; malicous intent

### Goals and Objectives
InfoParse proposes the following high-level goals to address this problem:

- Develop a proof-of-concept web dashboard that monitors trending topics on a single social media platform.
- Identify narrative patterns that may indicate misinformation, disinformation, or malinformation.
- Provide confidence and consensus indicators that communicate uncertainty transparently rather than asserting definitive truth claims.
- Highlight narrative origins and how they spread across sources.
- Demonstrate an ethical and explainable approach to AI-assisted analysis focused on awareness rather than adjudication.

### Project Merit and Impact
Successfully accomplishing these goals offers meaningful benefits across multiple audiences. For analysts, policymakers, journalists, and platform moderators, InfoWatch provides a visual and intuitive way to monitor emerging narratives without requiring deep technical expertise. At a societal level, this project also addresses the broader impact of misleading and manipulative narratives. Disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation can deepen social divides, inflame tensions, and erode trust between communities, particularly during moments of uncertainty or crisis. By helping users recognize emerging narratives early, this project reduces the likelihood that misleading content escalates into social unrest. In addition, improved visibility into how deceptive narratives spread can help protect vulnerable populations from exploitation, including financial scams, fraudulent campaigns, and emotionally manipulative messaging that disproportionately targets individuals with limited access to reliable information. By emphasizing awareness, context, and uncertainty, the system promotes cautious interpretation and responsible information sharing, empowering users to pause, question, and verify before reacting. At a time where narratives can shape outcomes before facts are fully understood, InfoParse offers a proactive, responsible way to see through the narrative.
